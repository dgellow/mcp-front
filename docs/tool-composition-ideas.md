# Tool Composition Platform Ideas for mcp-front

## Overview

This document explores the concept of extending mcp-front from a proxy into a "tool composition platform" that can augment MCP servers with additional capabilities and compose multiple tools into more powerful workflows.

## Compelling Use Cases

### 1. Intelligent Debugging Assistant
**Problem:** Production issue occurs. Need to correlate logs, database state, recent deployments, and code changes.

**Without composition:** Claude has to manually orchestrate: check logs → query database → list recent commits → search for related issues → correlate findings

**With composition:** A single "debug_production_issue" tool that:
- Parallelly fetches: error logs, database anomalies, recent deploys, related GitHub issues
- Correlates timestamps across all sources
- Identifies patterns
- Returns a unified debugging context

### 2. Code Impact Analysis
**Problem:** Before making a change, understand all implications across the system.

**Without composition:** Manually search code → check database schema → find API consumers → review tests

**With composition:** An "analyze_impact" tool that:
- Takes a function/table/API endpoint name
- Traces through: code dependencies, database foreign keys, API call graphs, test coverage
- Builds a complete impact map
- Highlights risky changes

### 3. Smart Migration Helper
**Problem:** Need to migrate data with zero downtime while maintaining consistency.

**Without composition:** Write migration → test locally → deploy → monitor → rollback if needed

**With composition:** A "safe_migration" tool that:
- Analyzes schema changes
- Generates migration with rollback
- Tests on sample data
- Monitors during execution
- Auto-rollbacks on anomalies

### 4. Cross-System Search
**Problem:** "Where is user X's data across all our systems?"

**Without composition:** Query each database → check each service → search logs → check file storage

**With composition:** A "find_user_data" tool that:
- Searches across: Postgres, Redis, S3, logs, Stripe, SendGrid
- Respects data privacy rules
- Returns unified view
- Shows data lineage

### 5. Automated Incident Response
**Problem:** When alerts fire, need consistent investigation and response.

**Without composition:** Check metrics → query database → notify team → create ticket → start runbook

**With composition:** An "respond_to_alert" tool that:
- Gathers context from multiple sources
- Executes preliminary fixes if safe
- Notifies relevant people
- Documents everything
- Suggests next steps

## Design Constraints & Realities

### What we CAN'T do:
- Modify how Claude interprets tools
- Change the MCP protocol
- Add new UI elements to Claude.ai
- Control conversation flow

### What we CAN do:
- Present composed tools as single MCP tools
- Use tool descriptions creatively
- Return rich, structured responses
- Maintain state between tool calls

## Design Approaches

### Approach 1: "Smart Tools"
Composed tools appear as regular MCP tools but do complex orchestration internally.

```
Tools available:
- query (basic postgres)
- debug_issue (composed: logs + db + github)
- analyze_impact (composed: code + db + deps)
```

**Pros:** Simple for Claude, powerful results  
**Cons:** Fixed compositions, less flexible

### Approach 2: "Tool Chaining Hints"
Tools return hints about what to do next.

```json
{
  "result": "...",
  "suggested_next_tools": [
    {"tool": "query", "reason": "Check user status", "args": {...}}
  ]
}
```

**Pros:** Guides Claude naturally, flexible  
**Cons:** Depends on Claude following suggestions

### Approach 3: "Workflow Templates"
Special tool that returns a workflow Claude can execute.

```
> use tool: get_workflow("debug_production")
< Returns: Step-by-step workflow with specific tool calls

> Claude then executes each step
```

**Pros:** Flexible, teachable  
**Cons:** Requires Claude to follow instructions

### Approach 4: "Context-Aware Tools"
Tools that know about previous tool calls in the conversation.

```
First: query database
Then: "analyze_query_results" - knows about previous query
```

**Pros:** Natural progression, builds context  
**Cons:** Hidden state, complexity

## Recommended Approach

Given the constraints, the sweet spot appears to be:

### Composed Tools as First-Class Citizens
- They appear as normal tools to Claude
- Internally orchestrate multiple operations
- Return rich, actionable results
- Include clear next-step suggestions

### Combined with Smart Tool Descriptions
- Descriptions that guide when to use them
- Clear value props that make Claude want to use them
- Examples in the description

This gives us:
- Immediate value (powerful tools)
- Natural UX (just another tool)
- Flexibility (can evolve internals)
- Reliability (doesn't depend on Claude being clever)

## Additional Ideas Discussed

### Tool Augmentation Example
Adding a `describe-schema` tool to mcp-postgres that doesn't exist in the original server:
- Returns prisma.schema with comments and types
- Includes human-written explanations of higher-level concepts
- Combines static files with dynamic queries

### LLM Memory System
A memory system for Claude to persist knowledge across conversations:
- Structured memories with schemas
- Categories: project context, decisions, code patterns
- Tools: remember, recall, forget, reflect, connect
- Challenge: Getting Claude to consistently check for relevant memories

## Next Steps

1. Prototype a simple composed tool (e.g., debug_issue)
2. Design the configuration schema for composed tools
3. Build the tool injection mechanism in MCP handler
4. Create admin UI for managing composed tools
5. Test with real use cases

## Open Questions

1. How do we handle data transformation between tools?
2. What level of abstraction is most useful?
3. How do we handle partial failures in composed workflows?
4. Should composition be static (config) or dynamic (code)?
5. How do we make the value obvious to Claude so it uses composed tools?
