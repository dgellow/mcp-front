OAuth 2.1 authentication lets you control access based on company email domains. Claude redirects users to Google for authentication, and MCP Front verifies they're from your company.

## How OAuth works with MCP Front

![OAuth 2.1 Authentication Flow](/mcp-front/oauth-flow.svg)

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud project
- Google Workspace domain (or any Google account for testing)
- Docker or the mcp-front binary

## 1. Set up Google OAuth

### Create OAuth credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID:
   - Type: Web application
   - Name: MCP Front
   - Authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:8080/callback` (for testing)
     - `https://mcp.company.com/callback` (for production)

### Configure OAuth consent screen

1. Choose "Internal" for Google Workspace
2. Add scopes: email, profile, openid
3. Save

## 2. Configure MCP Front

Create `config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "proxy": {
    "name": "Company MCP Proxy",
    "baseUrl": "https://mcp.company.com",
    "addr": ":8080",
    "auth": {
      "kind": "oauth",
      "issuer": "https://mcp.company.com",
      "allowedDomains": ["company.com"]
    }
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "database": {
      "url": "http://postgres-mcp:3000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Set environment variables

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

## 4. Run with Docker

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID \
  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -e JWT_SECRET \
  -v $(pwd)/config.json:/config.json \
  ghcr.io/dgellow/mcp-front:latest
```

## 5. Connect from Claude

1. In Claude settings, add MCP server:
   - URL: `https://mcp.company.com/sse`
   - Auth Type: OAuth
2. Claude will open a browser for Google login
3. Sign in with your company email
4. You're connected!

## Understanding domain restrictions

The `allowedDomains` field is your primary security control. Only email addresses from these domains can access your MCP servers:

```json
{
  "allowedDomains": ["company.com", "subsidiary.com"]
}
```

How it works:

- john@company.com ✓ Allowed
- jane@subsidiary.com ✓ Allowed
- hacker@gmail.com ✗ Rejected

This is perfect for companies using Google Workspace, as it automatically grants access to all employees while blocking external users.

## Production requirements

### Why Firestore?

In development, OAuth clients are stored in memory and lost on restart. In production, you need persistent storage:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "kind": "oauth",
    "storage": "firestore", // Required for production
    "gcpProject": "my-project-123"
  }
}
```

Firestore stores:

- OAuth client registrations
- User sessions
- Refresh tokens

### HTTPS is mandatory

OAuth 2.1 requires HTTPS in production:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://mcp.company.com", // Must be HTTPS
  "issuer": "https://mcp.company.com" // Must be HTTPS
}
```

Options for HTTPS:

- **Load Balancer**: Terminate SSL at the load balancer
- **Reverse Proxy**: Use nginx/caddy with Let's Encrypt
- **Managed hosting**: Deploy to any platform with automatic HTTPS

### Token expiration

Configure token lifetime based on your security requirements:

```json
{
  "tokenTTL": "4h" // Shorter = more secure, but more logins
}
```

Common settings:

- Development: "24h" (less frequent logins)
- Production: "4h" (balance security/usability)
- High security: "1h" (financial/healthcare)

## Troubleshooting

**"Redirect URI mismatch"**

- Ensure the callback URL in Google Console matches exactly
- Include the port if non-standard

**"Domain not allowed"**

- Check user's email domain is in allowedDomains
- Verify Google Workspace user exists

**"JWT secret too short"**

- JWT secret must be 32+ bytes
- Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`
