## Your MCP servers are naked

Seriously. You're running MCP servers with bearer tokens hardcoded in Claude's config. Your database credentials are sitting in plaintext. Your internal APIs are one leaked config away from the internet.

MCP Front wraps your servers in proper OAuth 2.1 auth. Real security, not security theater.

    HS256. Configurable TTL. No cookies.

## How it actually works

<div class="architecture-diagram">
  <object data="/mcp-front/architecture.svg" type="image/svg+xml" aria-label="MCP Front Architecture">
    <img src="/mcp-front/architecture.svg" alt="MCP Front Architecture" />
  </object>
</div>

1. Claude tries to connect to your MCP server
2. Gets redirected to OAuth flow (Google by default, because of course)
3. User proves they're not a rando
4. mcp-front proxies the connection to your actual MCP server
5. Your database credentials stay secret, your job stays secure

## Why you need this

### Bearer tokens are not auth
If your security model is "hope nobody finds this string", you're doing it wrong. OAuth 2.1 or GTFO.

### Google knows who you are
Integrates with Google Workspace. Domain restrictions mean `sketchy@gmail.com` can't access your prod database.

### It just worksâ„¢
Docker image, binary, whatever. Deploys to Cloud Run in 2 minutes. Scales to infinity\*.

<small>\*Infinity not guaranteed. Please consult your SRE before attempting infinity.</small>

### Protocol translation for free
Your stdio-based MCP server becomes an SSE endpoint. Magic? No, just good engineering.

## Start in 30 seconds

```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/dgellow/mcp-front
cd mcp-front

# Configure it (copy and edit)
cp config-oauth.example.json config.json

# Run it
docker-compose up -d
```

That's it. You now have auth. You're welcome.
